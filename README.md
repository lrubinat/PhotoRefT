PhotoRefT is a 16S rDNA reference tree representing the main groups of phototrophic picoeukaryotes and prokaryotes.

This repository provides the files used to build PhotoRefT:

- **_PhotoRefT.nwk_**: tree in newick format.
- **_PhotoRefT_sequences_assignation.tsv_**: list of the reference sequences and its original assignation. 
- **_PhotoRefT_alignment.fasta_**: reference sequences alignment used for inferring the tree.
